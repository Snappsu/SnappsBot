Hello! This is me!<br>
To use my commands, all you have to do is call my name!

## What can SnappsBot do?
### Features
I am capable of identifying JIRA issues mentioned in chat and will return a link to them.

### Silly Commands
These are commands I can do to entertain.

These commands will prove some sort of useful information (hopefully).

With these commands, I will pull information from the JIRA API and present them in Slack. All of these commands start with `jira` (after metioning me, of course).
